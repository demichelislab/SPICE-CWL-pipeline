fields:
  - name: beta_table
    type: File
    doc: |-
      Percentage of neutral reads (beta value) for each segment of the sample.
  - name: ploidy_table
    type: File
    doc: Average ploidy of the tumor sample.
  - name: admixture_table
    type: File
    doc: |-
      Fraction of normal tissue (admixture) that is detected in the tumor
      sample.
  - name: scna_clonality_table
    type: File
    doc: |-
      Clonality of each segment (fraction of the tumor cells that harbor each
      aberration).
  - name: allele_specific_cna_table
    type: File
    doc: |-
      Allele specific copy numbers (number of copies of the two parental
      alleles) and corrected log2-ratios (log2-ratios for which the effect of
      ploidy and admixture is removed) for each segment.
  - name: report_pdf
    type: File?
    doc: Pdf report of log2ratio values vs beta values for each segment.
  - name: snv_clonality_table
    type: File?
    doc: |-
      Clonality of each SNV (fraction of the tumor cells that harbor the SNV)
      and corrected allelic fractions (allelic fraction for which the admixture
      contamination is accounted for from the reference supporting reads).
